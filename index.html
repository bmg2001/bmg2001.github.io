<p class="section 1">One of the earliest drills I did as a young child was hitting a ball off the T with 

only my left hand. In order for the drill to work, you need ot choke up on the bat to the end of the 

grip tape. You position your hands near your head as if you were in the box preparing to swing at a 

pitch, both of your hands were on the bat, and you weren't choking up at all. You pull down through 

your swing the whole way, making sure to hit the center of the ball and push out all the way through 

extension. If you are a right handed batter, your left hand is the only one on the bat. If you are left 

handed, only your right hand will be on the bat.</p>
<p class="section 1">My second favorite drill stil requires a T. You will set it up at the correct height, 

and once your ball is on the bat, you will begin to do high knees. once your front foot hits the ground 

the third or fourth time, be ready to swing. when your back food hits that third or fourth time, in one 

smooth motion, stop your high knees and drive hard throught he ball. This drill keeps your hands and 

hips together and keeps your balance. If your balance is off, or if your hands and hips aren't together, 

you will fall or have a very weak swing and hit. It is a very good drill to do solo because you know 

when you are doing something wrong.</p>
<h3>Fielding Drills</h3>
<p>The simpliest fielding drill only requires two people. First, one person will roll the ball to their 

partenr 10 times. The fielder will stay low when they throw the ball back, and be ready to recieve the 

next ball. after 10 each you will switch. After each fielder recieved 10 throws, you will do the same 

thing again. Only this time you will throw one hoppers at the fielders feet. The object of this drill is to 

stay in front if the ball and work on staying low for a fast, hard, accurate throw. Once each fielder 

has recieved 10 one hoppers, you may move on to pop flys going to short, and just slightly to 

deep.</p>

<h3>Pitching Drills</h3>
<p>When you pitch, it is important to be well streched and to have done a series of drills to insure 

oyu wont hurt yourself or pull any muscles.</p>
<p>To begin your warm up process, you should start with your hand at your release point and just 

snap your wrist. You should only be about 3 feel away from your catcher. Go through every pitch 

with your had at your release point, just snapping your wrist.</p>
<p> After you have gone through wrist snaps at least 5 times with each pitch, move back and form a 

half circle. You should be turned sideways with your feet shoulder width apart, and your glove hand 

straight out in front. Put your throwing arm straght behind, oposite of your glove hand. Then, in one 

smooth motion, you just move your glove down to your hip and your throwing arm down to your 

release point. When your glove reaches your hip, your hand should be at your release point and  you 

should be snapping your wrist for the throw.</p>
<p>For the next warm up, you will start standing sideways the same way as the second warm up. 

You keep your feet still the entire time. You will twist your hips and put your arms straight out in 

from of you, facing the target. In one fluid motion, you will open your hips again and go through your 

motion. It is very important that you keep your feet still from the first set position. This drill works on 

keeping everythng together, working on your release point and not closing your hips to soon.
<p> This next warm up has a funny name, but is effective for working in your legs and perfecting 

timming. When performing the flamingo, if you are right handed, you will plave your right foot on the 

edge of the rubber so your toes are off the edge, and you will pick up your left foot, holding it bent at 

a 90 degree angle. You will then pitch, keeping your left foot off the ground when you start to work 

on a hard drive and long stride.
<p> The next drill if the walk through. If you are right handed, you will start with your right foot 

behind and to the side of your left foot. you will step, left, right, left, right. the second time your left 

foot hits you will bring your arms down for the swing back, and when your right foot hits the second 

time, you will jump right into your pitch, pushing of your right foot hard for a long stride. Make sure 

your release point is all the same and you stand up straight.</p>

<h3>After pitching</h3>
<p> When you pitch, it is very important to ice your arm. After you are sompletely done, you should 

place ice on your shoulder for 20 minutes. This will prevent injury and let your muscle relax.
